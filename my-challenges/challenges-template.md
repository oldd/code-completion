## The Codes

### Incomplete Code

```js
// code here with some missing lines or parts of lines

// use console asserts as checkpoints throughout the code
//    ie. if at line 5 the variable "toad" should have the value 8
//        then place an assert at line 6: console.assert(toad == 8, "wrong toad");

// place the input-output pairs console.assert statements
//    be sure to include helpful error messages
```

### Completed Solution


```js
// completed solution go here

// use good variable names, asserts, or logs to help explain your solutions
```
